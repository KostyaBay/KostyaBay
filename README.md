### 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!  

I'm a Master's student in **Applied Mathematics**, specializing in **Cryptography**. Passionate about **ZKPs, blockchain security, and cryptographic protocols**, I bridge **theory and practice** to build secure, privacy-focused solutions.  

🔐 **Interests**: Cryptographic Research, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Blockchain, Smart Contracts   
💻 **Tech**: Rust, Solidity, Circom, TypeScript, Golang  

> Cryptography is just **black magic**, and whoever understands it is a **common wizard** 🪄  

Let’s connect and build something secure! 🚀
